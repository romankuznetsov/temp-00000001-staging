# working "connecting". Naming a device that already exists is worse than it
# sounds - with lo, firewall4 resolved the zone's network list to it and put
# loopback in a zone whose input policy is DROP, MTU mangling and all.
#
# So the interface gets a device of its own, carrying nothing. Named after the
# interface, like the TUN device of a RAW-IP tunnel, which is what keeps it
# inside the qwdtt+ firewall zone instead of landing it somewhere unexpected.
#
# A TUN device with nothing attached to it rather than a dummy, which would be
# the obvious choice: dummy needs kmod-dummy, which an OpenWrt image does not
# carry by default, while kmod-tun is already required for the RAW-IP shape.

# The two shapes a qWDTT tunnel comes in, which differ in what the interface
# ends up owning rather than in how the transport works.
#
# rawtun is the tunnel itself: the client creates the TUN device, the server
# assigns its address, and the interface carries traffic like any other.
#
# wireguard carries no traffic of its own. The client relays a local UDP port
# through the VK call to the server, which forwards it to its own WireGuard
# port, so the interface provides an endpoint on 127.0.0.1 and nothing else -
# no device, no address, no routes. What uses it is an ordinary `proto
# wireguard` interface whose peer endpoint is that port, and everything about
# the WireGuard tunnel - keys, addresses, allowed IPs, routing - belongs to
# that interface.
#
# The ports are the server's two listeners, not its WireGuard port: that one
# is internal, reachable from the server's own loopback and nowhere else, and
# a client pointed at it is answered by nothing at all.
