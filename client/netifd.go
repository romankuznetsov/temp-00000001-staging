// rather than giving up, the relay reader has no deadline at all, and the
// result of the periodic TURN binding refresh is discarded. Measured on a
// router, the tunnel sat in that state for seven and a half hours, showing
// thirty-six of thirty-six workers, no reconnects and a session clock at
// fourteen hours, and one ifdown/ifup put it right in twenty seconds.
//
// Silence alone cannot be the trigger. The server answers nothing on an idle
// tunnel - measured, the only thing coming back is one STUN binding response
// per session per ten seconds, from the relay rather than from the server -
// so a watchdog on silence restarts a tunnel nobody is using. An earlier
// attempt inferred it instead, from the LAN sending while nothing came back,
// and that missed the outage above entirely: the router was not sending, so
// there was nothing to infer from.
//
// So the client makes the traffic itself. After netifdProbeAfter of nothing
// arriving it sends an echo through the tunnel to the server every tick, and
// a reply is inbound traffic like any other, which puts the question beyond
// inference: either the tunnel delivers the answer or it delivers nothing.
