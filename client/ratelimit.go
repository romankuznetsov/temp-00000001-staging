// wrong and is not: a session paced on its own takes ~44ms to clear a packet
// at a call's rate, far longer than the dispatcher will dwell on one relay,
// so the run of consecutive packets that keeps a flow on a single relay no
// longer fits and every packet leaves by a different one. Relays differ in
// latency by tens of milliseconds, so the far side receives a shuffle and
// reads it as loss. Measured at 256 Kbit/s over 18 sessions, per session
// against shared: 502 fast retransmits in 25s against 97, six timeouts
// against none, and a quarter to a third of every second carrying nothing at
// all against none. Shared, those runs survive, the tunnel holds 93% of its
// budget instead of 85%, and each session still averages the rate it was
// given.
//
// The burst is one packet, which is both the least and the most that works.
// A bucket too small to hold a packet would never release one and the tunnel
// would stall rather than slow down; a bucket holding a second of traffic is
// full whenever the tunnel has been quiet, so it empties at line speed and
// then waits to refill, which the TCP inside reads as a link going on and off
// rather than as a slow one.

// answers with RTO backoff rather than with a smaller window, which is worse
// than the loss it was avoiding - measured at 126 Kbit/s of 288 available,
