/* The qWDTT protocol class. A tunnel is a section of /etc/config/network with
   option proto 'qwdtt', so it is created, edited, started and stopped from
   Network -> Interfaces with the standard controls, and this file only has to
   describe the fields the protocol handler reads.

   What needs code is the hash list: the client accepts a full VK call link and
   reduces it to a hash itself (ParseHashes over the -vk flag), so storing a
   link would work -- but it would leave a link in the config and make the count
   on the status page misleading. Links are therefore reduced here, on save.

   That reduction is a translation of ParseHashes and normalizeVKJoinHash from
   the client's client/group.go, which is why this file is GPL-3.0-or-later and
   cannot be relicensed by one contributor alone: group.go carries no SPDX
   header of its own, inherits its repository's GPL-3.0, and has more than one
   author. Keeping the two in step also matters behaviourally -- if the

   the tunnel; the protocol handler refuses to come up rather than take the
   router's WAN down that way. The field for it belongs to the interface editor,
   so all this file can do is choose the number - see renderFormOptions.

   What decides which traffic enters the table is an ordinary `config rule`,
   and what stops traffic leaking to the WAN while the tunnel is down is an
   ordinary unreachable route in the same table. Neither is a qWDTT option --
   both are written here because every value they need is known here, and
   both are then editable on Network -> Routing like any other.

   One flag each, rather than one flag writing both: they answer different
   questions, and a single control could neither drop the kill switch on its
   own nor be turned off without taking a kill switch somebody wanted with
   it. */
