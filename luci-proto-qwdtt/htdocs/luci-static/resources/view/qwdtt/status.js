   out of the way of the poll, which rebuilds those rows from scratch every few

   Folded away until asked for: the page is read far more often than a tunnel
   is tested, and an empty box with a button is worth less than the room it
   takes. <details> rather than a widget of LuCI's, which has none for this.
   The heading is left at the size of the other headings and keeps the
   disclosure triangle, which is the part that says it opens.

   Drawn as a panel of its own, because cbi-section carries no background in
   these themes and a bare heading under a table reads as part of the table.
   The colours come from the theme's own variables rather than a literal white:
   the same names resolve to white on the light theme and to the dark panel
   colour on the dark one, where white would glare. Full width and the table's
   own bottom margin, so it lines up with what it sits under.

   The tunnel is chosen rather than assumed: a page with two of them has two
   answers, and -I is the whole point of asking here instead of over ssh. */
